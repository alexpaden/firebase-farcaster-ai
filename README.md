# Project Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and deploy your Firebase functions.

## Initial Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   Use `git clone https://github.com/alexpaden/firebase-farcaster-ai` to clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Change directory to the functions folder:**  
   Enter the directory with `cd /functions`.

3. **Install dependencies:**  
   Run `yarn` to install the necessary packages using yarn.

4. **Install Firebase Tools globally:**  
   If you don't have Firebase Tools installed, run `npm install -g firebase-tools` to install it globally.

## Configuration

5. **Set environment variables for Firebase:**  
   Set the necessary API keys for your project with the following command:  
   `firebase functions:config:set airstack.api_key="your_airstack_api_key" neynar.api_key="your_neynar_api_key" openai.api_key="your_openai_api_key"`  
   Replace the placeholders with your actual API keys.

## Testing and Deployment

6. **Test locally with the Firebase emulator:**  
   To set up Firebase environment variables for localhost, run `firebase functions:config:get > .runtimeconfig.json`.  
   Then start the emulator with `yarn serve`.

7. **Deploy to Firebase:**  
   Deploy your functions to Firebase using `yarn deploy`.

## Using the API

### Retrieve Thread Data

**Endpoint:** `/thread`

**Method:** GET

**Description:**  
Fetches thread data from Firebase, optionally refreshes the data by calling external APIs and summarizing the data using OpenAI's services.

**Query Parameters:**
- `hash` (required): The unique hash identifier for the thread.
- `replies`: The number of premium replies to include in the summary using social capital scores by airstack.xyz and cast data by neynar.xyz.
- `refresh`: Whether to generate a new summary or grab the existing one from the Firestore database. Valid values are `true` or `false`.

**Example Request:**  
http://127.0.0.1:5001/test-3851e/us-central1/api/thread?hash=0x6c5dea44f96bd0fdcccf0dc9b8d506115cb35734&replies=7&refresh=false
